# Fraction-Calculator
To perform Arithmetic Operations on Fractions
## Description
---

This project is designed to help practice building our own object class and testing it with a client class.There will be two classes ,one called Fraction and the other called FractionCalculator.The Fraction class is an object that holds information about a fraction (numerator and denominator).It will allow the user to enter in fractions and operations ,calculating and displaying the result. The FractionCalculator, a client class will create a object of Fraction class and will test it.It will perform  addition , subtration , divide , multiply and reduce the fration to its lowest form.

## Skeleton of class
### Data Variables

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**a. numer (private Integer variable)** | This is an integer variable that will store the numerator of the fraction.

**b. deno (private Integer variable)** | This is an integer variable that will store the denominator of the fraction.

**c. indent (Private static class)** | This is a private static class which will store the functionalities of Indentation and beautification of output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods
 Various methods were used in this program in order to make things generic and feasible to code. Stated below are the methods with their functionalities that were used in this program.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**a. Fraction add (Fraction other)** | This method will return a new Fraction that is the sum of other and this fractions.

**b. Fraction subtract (Fraction other)** | This method will return a new Fraction that is the difference between the other and this fraction.

**c. Fraction divide (Fraction other)** | This method will return a new Fraction that is the division of the other and this fraction.

**d. Fraction multiply(Fraction other)** | This method will return a new Fraction that is the product of the other and this fraction.

**e. Integer gcd(Integer a , Integer b)** | This method will return greatest common divisor of two number.

**f. void toLowestTerms(void)** | This method will return the lowest term of current fraction.

**g. Integer TakeInput(void)** | This method will return 1 if the input is valid otherwise -1.

**h. void start(void)** | This method will act as a hub between Fraction and FractionCalculator.

**i. void Menu(void)** | This method is created to display Menu as well as respond according to the input provided by the user.

## 3. How to Run (Terminal)
 __Step 1__ | First clone the project in any directory.<br>
 __Step 2__ | Open terminal in that same directory.<br>
 __Step 3__ | Run command ``` javac FractionCalculator.java ``` to compile the java code.<br>
 __Step 4__ | Run command ``` java FractionCalculator``` to run the code.<br>
 __Step 5__ | Enjoy the game budd!!...:wink: <br>
